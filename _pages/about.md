# 🐝 About Me
I am currently a **junior student** from [School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering](https://bme.buaa.edu.cn/), [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/). 

I am priviledged to serve as a **research assistant** at [Birth Lab](https://birthlab.github.io/) led by [Prof. Qiyuan Tian (田启源)](https://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1143/2126.htm) from [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), and my mentor is PhD. student [Mingxuan Liu (刘铭轩)](https://arktis2022.github.io/). I was previously advised by [Prof. Tao Liu (刘涛)](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/TaoLiu/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Prof. Xiaoyu Liu (刘笑宇)](https://shi.buaa.edu.cn/liuxiaoyu/zh_CN/index.htm) from School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Beihang University.

My researches focuse on **AI for neuroscience**, specifically targeting post-stroke cognitive impairment assessment and rehabilitation, and prenatal eeuroimaging analysis and diagnostics.
